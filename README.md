# This code snippet implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pneumonia detection using the Chest X-Ray Images dataset. It begins by importing necessary libraries and mounting Google Drive to access the dataset stored there. ImageDataGenerator is utilized to preprocess the data and generate batches of images for training and validation. The CNN model architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. It is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. The model is trained using the fit method, and training/validation accuracy and loss are plotted over epochs. This code provides a foundation for building and training CNN models for medical image classification tasks, specifically pneumonia detection, in Google Colab.
